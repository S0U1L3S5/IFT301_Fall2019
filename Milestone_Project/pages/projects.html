                        <p> I am working alongside a 2 other students to complete this project.

The project will track if people leave the event early through geofencing and will allow elevated user to pull information needed to fill out volunteer hours. This project is being developed with Django</p>

                        <h5>Status: Complete | 2018.12.10</h5>
                        <p> For this project I build a small database of alcholol (beer, wine, and spirits) to demonstrate an understanding in the design and implementation of databases. I utilized a Arch based Linux OS to host the web services and the database was built on MariaDB. PHP5 was the scripting languaged used to interact and manipulate data. A website was created to interface with the data through queries/reports as well as forms that allowed users to enter data into the database (if the proper privilages were on thier account). Class Project utalized: Manjaro Linux, MariaDB, PHP5, HTML, and CSS. </p>
